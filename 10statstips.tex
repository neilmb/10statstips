\maketitle

Many students and professionals are called on to do research without the
benefit of enough formal training in statistics.  Most people have never taken
a statistics class, and for the people who have taken such a class, it may
have been in the distant past or it may not have covered the practical issues
that actual researchers need.  This paper gives the kind of tips that students
and professionals need to actually do research using statistics.

Perhaps you are someone who has been asked by your boss to do a survey and
present the results.  Perhaps you are someone who has to use statistics for
your research in the sciences or social sciences.  This document is for you!
